Goal: To create a program in Java that can manage database table/rows for vending machines
using the tutorials located at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAQNNR8IlB4R7NfqBY1frapYo97L6fOQ
as a launching point.
Initial tables would focus on Accounts, machines, and logs to be expanded on later.
